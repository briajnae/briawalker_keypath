# Equilibrium Calculator 
### Built & Designed by Bria Walker

Hello! Welcome to my project. I designed this project using `HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, Google Fonts API, and jQuery`. 
With this project, users will be able to do the following: 

- Recieve recent, Google Scholar articles about equilibrium prices and quantity
- Search Amazon's products 
- Receive real-time data, including current product pricing and images  
- Use real products to formulate the best solutions to achieve equilibrium pricing.

I edited the calculations so that users can input their values to calculate.
